# ATM-Project

A really simple project in C# utilising basic functions and parameters. 

The idea is that The programme has a database of cardHolder users, these each have thweir own names, card number, PIN number and balance of their corresponding accounts. 

The application allows the users to verify their card number using their PIN, then to deposit/withdraw or check balance of their account. The deposit/withdrawal functions also update the balance in real time. 

The app has a few catches to avoid crashing, for example, if a user enters incorrect details into the terminal.
